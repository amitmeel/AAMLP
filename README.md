Approaching (Almost) any machine learning problem by Abhishek Thakur

This repo is created to learn from the book  "Approaching (Almost) any machine learning problem by Abhishek Thakur".

To start, create a conda environment using below command:
```
conda create -n environment_name python==3.7
```
once the environment is created, you can activate the environment using below command:
```
conda activate environment_name
```
To deactivate the environment use the below command:
```
conda deactivate
```

and once the environemnt is activated you can install the required python package from pip and conda using below command:
```
conda/pip install package name
```

For this book you can directly create a conda environment using the environments.yml using the below command (for linux users):
```
conda env create -f environments.yml
```
This command will create a virtual environment named aamlp and you can activate it using the below command:
```
conda activate aamlp
```

I'm currently using the windows system and sometimes some python package are not available in conda, so i prefer to install all package with pip using below command (after creating the virtual environment as mentioned at the start):
```
pip install -r requirments.txt
```
