Approaching (Almost) any machine learning problem by Abhishek Thakur

This repo is created to learn from the book  "Approaching (Almost) any machine learning problem by Abhishek Thakur".

To start, create a conda environment using below command:
```
conda create -n environment_name python==3.7
```
once the environment is created, you can activate the environment using below command:
```
conda activate environment_name
```
To deactivate the environment use the below command:
```
conda deactivate
```

and once the environemnt is activated you can install the required python package from pip and conda using below command:
```
conda/pip install package name
```

For this book you can directly create a conda environment using the environments.yml using the below command:
```
conda env create -f environments.yml
